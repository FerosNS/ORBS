Online Roleplaying Battle System(ORBS)
It is an online roleplaying system that will allow players to create characters and give them basic stats in the beginning to allow progression, basic actions such as attacking, hunting, and other stuff to give players direction in story creation. At this time I'm at the planning stages of acquiring the neccesary knowledge I need to make this happen.

-MySQL database to create and contain character sheets and data
-Probability Engine for random generation of magical possibilities.
-Keyword/phrase recognition engine to process input text and display possible actions.
-Generation of character sheets
